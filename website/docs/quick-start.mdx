## 1. Downloading the latest R version

It is necessary to have the [**R 4.0.0 version (or higher)**](https://www.r-project.org/) installed in order to be able to run this code. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. To
[download R.](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html), please choose your
preferred [CRAN mirror.](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). **Please make sure you have restarted your R session once you have installed the latest R version.**

## 2. Installing the package

Please run `remotes::install_github("facebookexperimental/Robyn/R")` to install the package. If you haven't installed the `remotes` package previously, run `install.packages('remotes')`first.

Robyn requires the Python library [Nevergrad](https://facebookresearch.github.io/nevergrad/).
You must install it once for the code to work properly.
Please find [here](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_packages.html) more info about installing Python packages via reticulate.

1. First step is to install the [reticulate package](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) via the following command: `install.packages(‘reticulate’)`
2. Load the package using: `library(reticulate)`
3. Install nevergrad. You have 2 options:


- **Option 1: nevergrad installation via PIP**

```
virtualenv_create("r-reticulate")
py_install("nevergrad", pip = TRUE)
use_virtualenv("r-reticulate", required = TRUE)
```

- **Option 2: nevergrad installation via conda**

```
conda_create("r-reticulate") # must run this line once
conda_install("r-reticulate", "nevergrad", pip=TRUE)
use_condaenv("r-reticulate")
```

If it's taking too long to download, you have a slow or unstable internet connection, and have issues while installing the package, try setting `options(timeout=400)`

In case nevergrad still cannot be imported after installation, please locate your python file and run this line using your path:
```
use_python("~/Library/r-miniconda/envs/r-reticulate/bin/python")
```
For Windows, if you get openssl error, please see instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54558389/how-to-solve-this-error-while-installing-python-packages-in-rstudio/54566647) and [here](https://dev.to/danilovieira/installing-openssl-on-windows-and-adding-to-path-3mbf) to install and update openssl.

## 3. Getting started with the [demo.R](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/blob/main/demo/demo.R) script

Open the [demo.R](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/blob/main/demo/demo.R) script in the inst folder as a quick start guide that aims to cover most common use-cases.
The demo will allow you to test the package using a simulated dataset.
